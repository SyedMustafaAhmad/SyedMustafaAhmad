# Greetings ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Syed Mustafa Ahmed**. Currently doing my Master's in **Computer Science**. I'm interested in operating systems, Linux, physics, spacecrafts and free open-source software. Currently, I am a novice so my current projects are very basic in nature. Although, I do have some interesting one's I'm currently invested in so I'm excited to share them and get some feedback.
